# DateHack

A 2D Hack & Slash / Dating Simulator cross-over game written in Go using Fyne.

## Makefile Instructions

`make build`: Builds an executable file for the game.

`make clean`: Cleans up Go build artifacts and removes the executable.

`make run`: Runs the game without creating an executable.

## Compilation (For Windows)

1. Run `make build` in terminal
2. Run `.\HackDate.exe` in teminal

Since this is for a game we will not yet target Mac / Linux as external tools can help there.

### Testing Without Compilation

In the case where you do not want to compile the application you can run `make run` in terminal to bypass compilation.
